# PanicOnRails Project Goals

## Vision

PanicOnRails is a **web-based train track planning and simulation tool** that lets users design model railway layouts and watch trains run on them. It emphasizes:

1. **Accessibility** - Free, browser-based, no installation required
2. **Performance** - 60 FPS rendering with large track networks
3. **Fun** - "Digital toy" experience with satisfying interactions

## Core Gameplay Pillars

1. **Build** - Place tracks, switches, signals using drag-and-drop
2. **Simulate** - Watch trains traverse the network, follow switch states
3. **Chaos** - Enjoy spectacular crash physics and visual effects

## Target Audience

- Model railway hobbyists exploring digital planning
- Casual users who enjoy sandbox building games
- Fans of train simulation games

## Technical Goals

- Support 1000+ track segments without performance degradation
- Accurate graph-based routing through switches
- Realistic Bézier curve traversal for smooth train movement
- State serialization for saving/loading layouts

## Design Philosophy

- **Digital Toy** - Fun first, realism second
- **Instant Gratification** - No complex tutorials, jump right in
- **Streamer Friendly** - Visually engaging, shareable chaos moments
